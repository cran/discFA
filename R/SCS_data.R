#' @description
#' The Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS) was developed to assess tendencies toward sexual preoccupation and hypersexuality. Items were initially derived from self-descriptions of persons who self-identify as having a ‘sexual addiction’. The self-descriptors were taken from a brochure for a sexual addictions self-help group. The scale should predict rates of sexual behaviors, numbers of sexual partners, practice of a variety of sexual behaviors, and histories of sexually transmitted diseases.
#' The data set were available at \url{http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/} and updated at 7/16/2012. The data set has 3376 observations with 13 variables of which 10 variables (Q1 to Q10) were the questions about the description of the sexual behaviour.
